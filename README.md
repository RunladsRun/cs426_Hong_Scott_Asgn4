Formal Elements:
 • Players = 1 ~ 6 players 
 • Objectives = Carrying a golden ball to the end of the obstacle courses as fast as possible
 • Procedures = WASD - move, Mouse - locate, Spacebar - jump, Left-Click - shoot
 • Rules = Players and balls can't get outside of the map boundary, if the ball reaches the goal, it will display the final record in seconds.
 • Resources = Terrain, time, objects
 • Conflict = Passing the various obstacles, and disturbing other players move
 • Boundaries = Sides of the map is all blocked by buildings and other objects so players can only move within the map.
 • Outcome = Time record

Added Components:
 • Physics Constructs: Bushes, and panels
They bounce players or balls when they collide. Basically they are obstacles to interrupt players, but players can also utilize these to shorten record by jumping on these.
 • Billboard: City billboard screen
This is an object to emphasize the urban atmosphere of the map.
 • Lights: Street Light, and Trucks
Each light sources are located at the entrance and the end point of the obstacle course so that players can clearly identify the start and end of the map.
